        Hi, I'm Nick. A software developer focused on the pursuit of ideas that
        put people first. I believe that in order to create and sustain an
        inclusive workspace we need to ensure that there exists an atmosphere of
        accomodating diversity of thought, expressions, and views. <br /> <br />
        Only then will we truly soar.
