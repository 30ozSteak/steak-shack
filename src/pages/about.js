        Hello, I'm Abdus Salam, a self-taught Product Designer passionate about
        designing digital experiences that leave a positive impact on people,
        environment and the society. I am a native of Lahore, Pakistan, and have
        a background in Telecommunication; in which I hold a Bachelor of
        Engineering degree. Six months into my graduation - out of pure
        interest, I quit my Engineering job and made a conscious decision of
        moving into design, an enterprise which has led me to adopt it as a full
        time career and develop my skills in UX and visual design. During the
        past 7+ years of working in diverse industries including education,
        health, media, SaaS and non-profits, with environments ranging from tiny
        startups to Fortune 500 companies, I have exposed myself to various
        challenges involving user experience and visual design. My designs have
        been instrumental in raising a $14 million funding for a healthcare
        startup, and products being used by millions across the planet.
